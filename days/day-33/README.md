# Task:  Integrating Virtual Machines with Application Load Balancer

The Nautilus DevOps team is currently working on setting up a simple application on the Azure cloud. They aim to establish an Azure Load Balancer in front of a Virtual Machine (VM) where an Nginx server is currently running. While the Nginx server currently serves a sample page, the team plans to deploy the actual application later.

## Task Details

1. Set up an Azure Load Balancer named `xfusion-lb`.
1. Configure the Load Balancer’s frontend IP configuration with the name `xfusion-lb-ip` and assign a public IP address with the same name (`xfusion-lb-ip`).
1. Create a backend pool named `xfusion-backend-pool` and add the VM running Nginx to this pool.
1. Create a health probe named `xfusion-health-probe` on port `80` to check the VM's health.
1. Set up a load balancer rule named `xfusion-lb-rule` to route traffic on port `80` to the backend pool on port `80`.
1. Add an inbound rule to the existing NSG of the VM to allow HTTP traffic on port `80`.
